# Hike2Earn
Hike2Earn is a Web3 app that gamifies trekking and mountain climbing. Users mint NFTs as proof of summit achievements and earn tokens proportional to the height of each mountain. A monthly sponsor-backed prize pool (e.g. Adidas) rewards climbers, creating a transparent, community-driven challenge that connects outdoor adventure with blockchain.
