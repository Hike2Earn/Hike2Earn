# Hike2Earn Project

##Problem
Mountaineering faces a growing sustainability crisis: iconic peaks like Everest and Kilimanjaro are overwhelmed by overcrowding, waste accumulation, and severe environmental degradation, while thousands of lesser-known mountains remain ignored. This concentration of tourism not only damages fragile ecosystems and endangers climbersâ€™ safety, but also highlights the lack of incentives for adventurers to practice responsible and sustainable exploration.

##Our Proposal
Hike2Earn offers an innovative solution by rewarding climbers for exploring lesser-known peaks and participating in mountain clean-up campaigns. Through a system of tokens and challenges, the app decentralizes tourism pressure away from overcrowded destinations while directly incentivizing environmental responsibility. By turning sustainable exploration into a rewarding experience, Hike2Earn builds a community where protecting the mountains is just as valuable as conquering them.
